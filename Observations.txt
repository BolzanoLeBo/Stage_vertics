survey : 

DVFS => favorise low frequency when deadline is easily met.
Indeed in flash execution high frequency => high energy due to wait states https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wait_state#:~:text=A%20wait%20state%20is%20a,that%20is%20slow%20to%20respond.
(not true with ccm) 

possible algo : 
- use DVFS when code running on FLASH
- take the highest frequency when code running from CCM 

=> win time thanks to ccm so we can lose time on other FLASH codes 

ex : pointer chase at 72 MHz on CCM  
     RSA at 24 MHz on Flash
     0.2362 s and 15 921 uJ 

     Normal case at highest freq 
     0.2502 s and 23 581 uJ 
To change clock frequency we need also some times 
but at the end we have the same runtime but a lower energy consumption 

    fib at 72 MHz on CCM 
    Kalman at 24 MHz on Flash 
    0.09709 s   7180 uJ 

    Normal case at highest freq 
    0.0918 s    9414 uJ

    both 72 MHz but fib on CCM 
    0.0728 s	7536 uJ
